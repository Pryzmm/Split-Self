# Split Self | Minecraft Horror Mod

## DISCLAIMER
This mod will interact with your device, **OUTSIDE OF THE GAME!** Your PC will not be damaged in any way, and any changes made to your device are easily able to be reverted. If you feel unsafe using this, or if the mod is not supported on your device, you may download the safe version, which is found along every Github release.

## Installation
Download one of the two mods from the [latest release page](https://github.com/Pryzmm/Split-Self/releases).
  - The unsafe version interacts with your device outside of the game.
  - ~~The safe version doesn't, but it's less fun that way! :(~~ *Safe version currently unavailable until Full Release*

Download the [Fabric Installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and the [Fabric API mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).

Add Split Self and Fabric API to your mods folder.

Launch Minecraft, and watch as you lose control.

### Thank you to everyone who supported me while making this! (You know who you are <3)
